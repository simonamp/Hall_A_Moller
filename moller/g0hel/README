  ============================
  Here you find codes related to G0 helicity sequence.
                                ======================
  There are two codes

      seqgen24.C   -- Generates an output ASCII file f1.txt
                      with the full sequence of G0 helicity
                      sequence (16777216 words of 0's and 1's)

     g0helicity.C  -- This is the code to read the text file of
                      helicity data (like f1.txt produced above, but 
                      the file name it looks for is "helicity.data") 
                      and test it by predicting the helicity. 
                      This is an example of what to do in the
                      analysis of data.

  Notes:

    Both codes compile with g++ on RedHat Linux and probably
    elsewhere with g++.  e.g.

         g++ -o seq seqgen24.C

         g++ -o g0h g0helicity.C

    Then do something like this
          ./seq ;   ln -s f1.txt helicity.data ;  ./g0h

    It is a worthwhile exercise to deliberately modify "helicity.data"
    and change the helicity a few times to introduce errors, then run 
    g0helicity.C and observe that it recovers.  This is how the code 
    would recover from some "glitch" (e.g. deadtime or a false reading
    of helicity).
